Hello GÃ¶kce
This is my program of Spare_parts_inventory_assistant

The program can detect if you are looking for the parts in the inventory by writing the specific parts name. If you do, the program is happy and closes.
But if you write something thats not in the inventory (f.ex. gripper), the program says that the part is not in inventory. 
You can also look for available parts by writing "do you actually have any parts?" and then the program will give you the available parts.
